# ecourts-scraper

This is a Python package to help scrape information from the ECourts Service.

The final goal is to cover all services under the `ecourts.gov.in` domain, but it currently
supports a few services covered at https://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/ecourtindiaHC/.

It covers all the High Courts and their various benches.

## Case Types

Each of the individual courts use their own numbering system for various case-types. So the same type of case might have different ID depending on the court. This can even vary between various benches of the same High Court. For example, HCB (Habeas Corpus Petition) is numbered the following different ways across various courts (not exhaustive):

Court |ID
------|----
Madras High Court - Principal Bench| 22
Madras High Court - Madurai Bench | 164
High Court of Jammu and Kashmir - Jammu Wing|17
High Court of Jammu and Kashmir - Srinagar Wing|171

As such, before doing any kind of work that relies on case type (such as fetching case details, or orders by case type) - you must get the relevant case type idenfiers. You can run:

`ecourts get-case-type --state-code [state-code] --court-code [court-code]` to
get the case type identifiers for a particular court. If the
`state-code/court-code` identifiers are not provided, the case types will
be fetched for all known courts. A list of all known courts is available
at [courts.csv](courts.csv) published as part of the source code.

## Types

The primary two classes that most users will deal with are Court, and ECourt. A court is one of the high court benches covered at https://hcservices.ecourts.gov.in/ecourtindiaHC/,
and an ECourt is the primary class that deals with the website.

Other entities involved are more legal in nature:

- Business
- Case
- CaseType
- FIR
- HistoryEntry
- Objection
- Order
- Party - Either a petitioner or a responded to a case.
